## Machine Learning (Task 2)
### Troubles in Getting Dataset...
Being such a peculiar topic as the Tidal Volume of lungs, it was extremely tough to find a relevant dataset.
I searched through Research Papers which told how much data they had trained their Model upon, but couldn't find the datasets the model
was trained on. I even mailed some organisations for their datasets, but to no avail. I finally found a really old dataset on 
Kaggle, which had all the data I needed with 725 entries, which is enough, I think, to train the model for this task.
